# American Express – Default Prediction (Systems Analysis)

---

# WorkShop 2
The development of Workshop 2 was carried out by expanding the system analysis conducted in Workshop 1 and translating it into a concrete system design for the American Express Default Prediction project. The team defined the system’s functional and non-functional requirements, focusing on data processing, model training, evaluation, monitoring, scalability, and reliability. A high-level architecture was then designed, structured into three main subsystems — Data Pipeline, Model Lifecycle, and Operations & Monitoring — applying systems engineering principles such as modularity, scalability, maintainability, and feedback control.
Additionally, the workshop incorporated sensitivity and chaos considerations related to financial data behavior, addressing how small variations can produce significant changes in model outputs. To mitigate these effects, strategies such as regularization, cross-validation, performance monitoring, and periodic retraining were proposed. Finally, a preliminary implementation sketch and technology stack were outlined, specifying tools, frameworks, and design patterns suitable for building a scalable and robust predictive system.
