# WorkShop 3
The development of Workshop 3 was carried out by applying systems engineering principles to strengthen the design of the SmartRisk system. The architecture from previous workshops was refined by integrating robustness and quality guidelines inspired by ISO 9000, CMMI, and Six Sigma. A risk analysis was conducted to identify potential system failures, assess their probability and impact, and define mitigation and monitoring strategies. A project management plan was also established, including team roles, milestones, and selected tools to guide the development process. Finally, incremental improvements from earlier workshops were documented, along with a brief reflection on lessons learned, ensuring continuous system evolution and readiness for future project phases.
